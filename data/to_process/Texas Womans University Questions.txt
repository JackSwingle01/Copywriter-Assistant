We are looking forward to the upcoming kickoff of your project! The Art Direction and Design teams will be asking you some questions during the call to help us get ready to create your concepts! 
Please review these questions prior to the meeting, as we will be discussing them together.


Tell us a little about your school! (Examples: What impression should students have of your school once they go through the orientation? What makes your school unique? Do you have any spotlight programs that create a big draw for students? Do you have student life activities, events, or notable traditions? Do you have a mascot? Are there any iconic locations on the campus of visual interest?)

Mascot: Oakley (Texas Barn Owl)

Nickname: Pioneers

Nation’s largest university system focused on women

On the Denton campus: Fountain, Library, Stark/Guinn (two tall residential towers can be seen from miles away), Little Chapel-in-the-Woods, Pioneer Woman (statue), redbud trees, “She Gave Us Wings” (statue)

Texas Woman’s offers degree programs in the liberal arts and sciences, nursing, health sciences, business and education. Campuses in Denton, Dallas and Houston are joined by an e-learning campus offering innovative online degree programs. 

University Symbols and Traditions: https://twu.edu/traditions/ 


Who is the audience for your online orientation, and at what point will they go through the orientation in the matriculation process? (Demographics, member groups)

Approximately 16,000 students

89% women, 11% men

HSI, 67% of TWU’s undergraduate students are represented by minority students (34% Hispanic, 31%white, 20% black, 11% Asian/Pacific Islander, 4% International/Other)

First-year students, transfer students, dual enrollment students, graduate students (Hoping to have different instances for each group with a lot of overlapping information)



Do you have a previous orientation you would like us to reference for this orientation? (Any prior outlines, in-person orientation agendas, etc.)

Yes


Do you have a unique name for the online orientation? 


Are there any themes or taglines that need to make an appearance in the orientation?

Boldly Go


Does your school have current, up-to-date branding guidelines and resources available for us to reference and utilize? (Vector logos, color palettes, web fonts, images, and preferred photographic styles to utilize them with, graphical approach, etc.) 

https://twu.edu/marketing-communication/brand-guidelines/ 


For the graphical style of the online orientation concepts, think of some keywords that come to mind on the visual approach you are looking to see. (Example: Bold, Modern, Traditional, Active, Subtle, Calm, Open, Dark, Clean, Vibrant, Bright, Exciting, Fun, etc.)

Modern, Clean, Bold


Are there dos and don’ts for your school’s brand and art style? (Example: Are there design elements that have been overused in the past and should not be used now? Are there preferred graphical elements, shapes or photographic styles that must be used and/or avoided? Etc.)

On external pieces, we maroon (PMS 202C) must be the dominate color (60-80%)

Do not use green (any shade) or orange

People often misspell the name of the university…we are WomAn’s, not WomEn’s


Do you wish us to reference your school’s online presence for any graphical inspiration or elements? (Example: The main university website, social media graphics, etc.)

Do you have an online photo gallery for reference? (Example: Flickr, SmugMug, Photo Shelter, Google Drive, etc.)

Do you have additional marketing or student-facing print materials in PDF format that we could reference for additional inspiration? (Direct mail, brochures, viewbooks, flyers, banners, ad campaigns, etc.)
